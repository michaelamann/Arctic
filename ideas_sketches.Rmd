I want to use 

1. match up lees top zOTUs with lehos dataset and see whe


for every genus with at least 3 members:


create a map where a facet for each member and overlay: gray - every instance of that genus. blue - every instance within 97%. and then in green - every instance at 100%. 

I want to find particular genera that seem to have unique arctic species.
