```{r setup}
library(tidyvere)
```


```{r read in zotu table}

zotu_table <- 
  read_table("ZOTUs/zotu_table.txt") %>%
  rename(zOTU = `#OTU`)


```


```{r exploratory}
sample_totals <- 
  zotu_table %>%
  select(-negcontrol) %>% # hit rare things that werent included as zotus
  pivot_longer(cols = where(is.numeric), names_to = "Sample", values_to = "Abundance") %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(Abundance), .groups = "drop")
summary(sample_totals$total)
